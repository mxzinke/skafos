# Skafos

Skafos is an opinionated framework and guide which brings an **abstraction to more easily deploy applications** on top of the [Open Application Model (OAM)](https://oam.dev) in a [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech) manner and Kubernetes as control-plane without thinking about infrastructure, observability, data storage, messaging and or other things.

> The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.\
> â€• Edsger Dijkstra

_The project should live within the community of open source and leverage the knowledge and experiance made by companies which already made issues on setting up a framework like this._

## Goals

For me it's important to ...

TODO

## Non-Goals

TODO

## Batteries included

I will try to include...

* Helm Chart - install the control-plane
* Example - using the framework to deploy an application in the cloud
* Documentation - showing best practice
* CLI-Tool - for Developers & Operators to generate Definitions (getting started more easily)


But still this is a lot to do and will take time until we are there.
